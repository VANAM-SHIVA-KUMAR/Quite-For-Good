## Description

We have together made an NGO website - QUIT FOR GOOD aimed at helping individuals quit smoking. Our website offers a variety of resources, including information on the dangers of smoking, tips on how to quit, and support groups for individuals who are trying to quit.

Please visit our website and take a look around. If you or someone you know is struggling with smoking, we encourage you to reach out and utilize the resources available on our website.

I would like to thanks our teacher Shriram R sir for encouraging us to take up this project and see it through. It was also a great experience working with my teammate as we together came up with the idea.

Together, we can make a difference in the fight against smoking.
